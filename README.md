# simple-os

I would like to apply positions about firmware or operation system, such as linux engineer, platform engineer, etc. By the way, my thesis is to purpose a novel caching algorithm, but I have ever developed anything about that except my algorithm. I hope that I would have deep understanding of operating system via this side project.
